# Rita Mak's resume

Rita's online resume, to send to companies when applying to job vacancies. It was used Gatsby to develop the project and it is deployed [here](https://ritamak.gatsbyjs.io/).

It consists in:

- Home page.
- Contacts page with a form to contact me (via email) and some of my social media links;
- Projects page with some of my personal and professional (during the web development bootcamp) projects (repositories and websites).
- Detailed project page with more details on the project and all the tags;
- Tags page if you want so search for a project by tag (ex: projects using #Materialui)
